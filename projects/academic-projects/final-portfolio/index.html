                        <p>Welcome to my writing portfolio for the course WR150: Applied Ethics in America Today. Below,
                            you will find the work I have done throughout the semester for this class along with a table
                            of contents above. But first, I want to
                            analyze my growth over the semester. Entering the class, I honestly had no real grasp on
                            what philosophy was. However, I was able to recognize the propositional logic being used
                            from a computer science course I was taking and
                            quickly became excited. I learned on a deeper level about the connections propositional
                            logic had to the real world and how I can use it to form arguments. Soon, we moved onto
                            reading about moral frameworks and began discussing
                            them in class. Eventually, the class consisted mostly of discussions and readings. One of
                            the last things we did was teach the class about our topic and try to convince them of our
                            argument for our final paper. In this introductory
                            essay, I want to walk through my experiences in the class and how each one has strengthened
                            me as a writer.</p>
                        <p>WR150 started at a fast pace as we went through what my professor called a “Philosophy
                            Bootcamp.” During this, we had longer readings designed to cover more basic concepts and
                            ideas about philosophy itself. We trained on how to
                            recognize some basic arguments in the form of propositional logic, debated various
                            frameworks’ practicality, and battled these frameworks against each other in class. If it is
                            unclear how my writing improved, let me highlight
                            it now. With these various in-class discussions, not only was I engaged and enticed to learn
                            more about the subject, but I was also learning more about what a basic argument looks like.
                        </p>
                        <p>As a side note, something that I really enjoyed about the course was how relevant it was to
                            my other courses. I not only was mastering the basics concepts of reasoning and
                            argumentation, but also picking up the formatting of a
                            humanities essay and how to write one. These lessons proved very useful in the other class I
                            was taking, Introduction to Religion. The propositional logic I was absorbing in my computer
                            science course also married nicely with
                            the class and inspired me. </p>
                        <p>As we got farther into the course, we were tasked to write an argument against ourselves for
                            our Devil’s Advocate assignment. We were allowed to have a first thought on a subject, but
                            we had to spend most of our time crafting our
                            opponent’s argument. In the essay, I argued for hedonism even though I believed the idea was
                            false. I set up several counterexamples and went to great lengths to defend my opponent. I
                            learned that making a great argument means
                            that you cannot think one-sidedly, that you really must take into account your opponent’s
                            views and take them seriously. If you do not take your opponent’s views seriously, then your
                            argument is weak, it only exists to further
                            the ideas of others who think similarly. The whole point of arguing is to shift an
                            opponent’s perspective and learning to understand them on a deeper level has tremendously
                            helped improve my argumentation skills. </p>
                        <p>Next, we began discussing in class real-world issues about ethics in America. This was my
                            favorite part in the class. I began venturing into research about philosophy at Boston
                            University (BU) and learned that we had relevant thinkers
                            such as Noam Chomsky battle out with former BU President John Silber. I also heard Yosef
                            Abramowitz speak when he came back to visit BU, who was fighting for what he thought was
                            morally right when he founded the divestment
                            movement against apartheid at BU when he was an undergraduate. I realized that real-life
                            philosophy happens every day and what we were discussing in class was not just class-talk if
                            we took it seriously enough. I learned most
                            from these in-class discussions that we must prepare to defend our ideas against all kinds
                            of opponents and, therefore, it forced me to think more critically about what kind of
                            argument I was making.</p>
                        <p>Nearing the end of our semester, it was now time for us to present to the class a proposal
                            for our paper and teach them more about the topic we researched. We first did a curatorial
                            write-up recapping a conversation we had with
                            someone outside of class. I polished up my handout after this and rather cockily assumed I
                            would be able to just communicate everything I had learned in the research I had done for my
                            essay to the class with just the handout.
                            I ultimately failed in even getting to the main point of my argument. The topic, hookup
                            culture, even though it was specific, was still too broad for a philosophically grounded
                            debate. I ended up spending most of my time teaching
                            the class the basics of when consent is violated. I learned that, to have effective debates,
                            specificity is imperative. I had a general idea and I thought I was specific. I learned from
                            this experience that the more specific
                            you are, the greater your argument will be. </p>
                        <p>Finally, we are concluding the semester with our final paper, and I am glad for all the
                            lessons I learned along the way, <span class="print"> </span> as I use all of them in my
                            final essay. Overall, I have learned how to improve my skills as a writer by learning
                            strategies to more clearly communicate my ideas. I am walking away from this class as a
                            stronger writer.</p>

                        <h4>Final Draft: "On-Demand Happiness: Problems with Psychological Hedonism and Kantianism as an
                            Alternative"</h4>
                        <p>In today’s society where pleasure “on-demand” is becoming ever accessible through means such
                            as Netflix and Hulu, it is not far-reaching to imagine another society where the movies we
                            watch will be, instead, simulations of our
                            own lives. These simulations, as Robert Nozick poses in his thought experiment, “The
                            Experience Machine”<sup>1</sup>, could be generated to fulfill our deepest desires and allow
                            us to live a “better” life than our own. Would
                            you use the experience machine? Many, including myself, would be hesitant to say yes
                            although it may be unclear as to why. Nozick’s thought experiment is a rebuttal against
                            psychological hedonism, the claim that humans are
                            solely motivated by pleasure. In what follows, I lay out some of the arguments that
                            psychological hedonism gives, highlight the core issues psychological hedonism has, and
                            finally show why it cannot be accepted and push for
                            Kantianism, a less flawed philosophy.</p>
                        <p>My initial view on psychological hedonism is that it is false. I believe that humans are
                            motivated by far more than just pleasure. Religion is a popular source of greater meaning
                            for many. Following some reading, however, it became
                            clear to me that the existence and validity of religion itself can be questioned. According
                            to Karl Marx<sup>2</sup>, religion is the “opium of the people”. He believes it is a
                            delusion that mankind created as a means to accept
                            the unhappiness within ourselves. Some could argue that we did not create religion, yet the
                            problem with that is that Divine Command Theory<sup>3</sup> cannot be true. If mankind is
                            motivated by more than simple pleasure, then,
                            some will argue, he must also be motivated by religion. If mankind truly was motivated by
                            religion, then this is somewhat problematic. Suppose mankind created religion, then we would
                            not actually be motivated by religion; rather,
                            he would be motivated by the principles we used when creating the religion. If we argue that
                            mankind did not create religion, then Divine Command Theory must be true. Divine Command
                            Theory is false, proving that mankind simply
                            cannot be motivated by religion. Mankind can still be motivated by the practices of
                            religion, perhaps it gives them a sense of balance and pleasure in their lives, but this is
                            not religion. Mankind must be motivated by pleasure
                            if we followed this line of thinking. </p>
                        <p>However, this argument against religion as a motivator can be qualified; as mentioned
                            earlier, if mankind created religion, then mankind must be motivated by those principles
                            used to create the religion. What could be these principles?
                            Sigmund Freud would claim that the principle is an ‘oceanic’ connectedness<sup>4</sup>. It
                            is a feeling that you are part of a greater “plan” and you feel some “sense of purpose”.
                            Freud explains, however, that this ‘oceanic’
                            feeling is really just a psychological illusion, an effect of having an “ego”. He explains
                            that, when we are born, we are not autonomous, we have no sense of self, and develop this
                            feeling of autonomy later in life through
                            the development of one’s ego. The feelings and ‘senses’ you had before developing your ego
                            is this ‘oceanic’ feeling. Some people, claims Freud, simply do not lose this feeling. Even
                            if this ‘oceanic’ feeling idea were true
                            and one would be willing to accept the idea that humans have egos, it is doubtful that it is
                            what motivates us and still does not clearly connect to religion. Freud gives two alternate
                            theories as to what we could be motivated
                            by. The first one centers on our obsession with objects, order and everything around us
                            being in “the right place”. It is based on the idea that mankind draws inspiration of
                            organization from nature and seeks to replicate it.
                            Thus, what motivates us is drawn from that inspiration. A very interesting idea, but it
                            should be pointed out that this motivation is connected to and brings us pleasure. Freud
                            also points out that we may actually be motivated
                            by love and love of all things. He claims that, if mankind is motivated by more than just
                            pleasure, then mankind must also be motivated by love. This appears plausible, as there are
                            many things you do out of love, where you
                            do not necessarily derive pleasure. If mankind is motivated by love, then mankind will do
                            actions out of love. If mankind does actions out of love, then mankind is not motivated by
                            pleasure to do those actions. However, the
                            problem many have with Freud’s theory is that all love, or actions of love, involve
                            pleasure, intentional or not. They argue that humans simply pretend that these actions do
                            not bring them pleasure, but they really do. Whether
                            it is short term or long term, these actions of love are undeniably “pleasurable” in some
                            sense of the word. Therefore, mankind is really motivated by pleasure and mankind is not
                            motivated by love. We are motivated by nothing
                            more than just pleasure.</p>
                        <p>Some may still be led to believe that the argument that deals with love as a motivator is not
                            strong because it still leaves <span class="print"> </span>many other motivations other than
                            pleasure untouched. There are countless motivations that one could bring
                            up that are not, or at least appear to not be pleasure. Initially, this appears to be true,
                            maybe there is a motivation out there other than pleasure; but, a psychological hedonist
                            will ultimately conclude all actions are connected
                            somehow, someway to pleasure. There may be higher forms of motivations, such as love, yet
                            one still derives pleasure from them. The objection of love may seem weak, but it reveals
                            that something that is supposed to be one of
                            the most altruistic motivations is, in actuality, one of pleasure. Put simply, all
                            motivations are connected to pleasure, be it rational or irrational. Love, some naysayers
                            will argue, is irrational, therefore it cannot be
                            motivated by pleasure. Pleasure, too, can be irrational, it is connected to love, after all.
                            Even still, others will say avoidance of pain is not connected to pleasure. Still, this is
                            simply another form of pleasure. Pleasure
                            is a binary that cannot be escaped and is what defines all of our motivations. </p>
                        <p>While it is true that pleasure is involved in all of our decisions, a major problem with
                            psychological hedonism is that it too quickly points out that, if pleasure is involved in an
                            action, then the action must be motivated by
                            pleasure. Its conclusion is difficult to refute, yet, I still have reservations. I don’t
                            feel satisfied that humans are merely seeking pleasure and that is the root of all of our
                            motivations. Otherwise, as Nozick pointed out,
                            we would all use the experience machine. If psychological hedonism was supposed to be true,
                            we would see others simply filling their deepest and carnal desires all the time. A
                            psychological hedonist could object to this, pointing
                            out that this does not bring ultimate pleasure, but temporary, so this argument is untrue.
                            Immanuel Kant, an exceptional philosopher, pointed out that what motivates us, could be the
                            initial thought that we had, the initial
                            imperative; and, while pleasure could be a motivator, it is not initially what pushed us to
                            do an action. When a firefighter runs into a building to save someone, his first thought is
                            definitely not the pleasure he is going
                            to get from saving them, rather, it is something else. Kant had his own ideas of what this
                            could be and it is a major flaw in the argument against psychological hedonism that I am
                            making. Defining the motivation is a very difficult
                            task and, from an epistemic standpoint, the analysis of what motivates us may require an
                            impossible introspection of ourselves. However, psychological hedonism is not without its
                            own problems. The claim that pleasure drives
                            all actions, as mentioned earlier could still lead to a questionable, even objectionable,
                            society that is led only by carnal and sexual desire. Additionally, dismissing all forms of
                            motivation other than pleasure to really
                            be just pleasure is biased and myopic. How could one have the capacity to know for certain
                            that all motivations are merely pleasure? The problems that arise out of adopting
                            psychological hedonism are not only problematic, but
                            unacceptable, and must be remedied. If the psychological hedonist could satisfactorily solve
                            the problems it has with its philosophy, I would accept it. A Kantian view on what motivates
                            us, however, is more plausible. It does
                            have problems, yet the assuming nature of psychological hedonism is more flawed. It may be
                            impossible to decisively prove what motivates humans, and a Kantian view can accept this.
                            There are some who may not be satisfied not
                            knowing what motivates us, but it really may be impossible to prove and I am willing to
                            accept that.</p>

                        <p><em>The Issue:</em> The Stormy-Daniels-Donald Trump sex scandal is a recently “settled”
                            sexual (and political) scandal involving the pornstar Stormy Daniels, Donald Trump, and
                            Michael Cohen. The political history of the scandal
                            is complicated and elaborate, involving much naysaying and political deliberation that is
                            not important to this issue at hand. What’s more interesting and not as widely spoken of is
                            that Cohen admitted (in a convoluted manner)
                            that Trump did have a sexual encounter with Daniels.<sup>1</sup>
                        </p>
                        <p>This issue, rather surprisingly, has clear connections to what has become a seemingly norm in
                            society, at least in populous college societies, today: hook up culture. TinderU, a new
                            feature of the Tinder app (commonly seen as a
                            “hook up” app, although most use it to boost their egos) has increased the use among college
                            students across the U.S.<sup>2</sup> Although roughly only ⅕ of Tinder users admit to using
                            it for hooking up, cultural cues tell
                            me otherwise and that is not even mentioning the more promiscuous hook up app, Grindr. While
                            it may be easy to point fingers at Trump for engaging in a casual sex encounter (please
                            forget that he wrongly stole money and cheated
                            on his wife in the process), many of us college students have been engaging in these
                            behaviors for quite some time and our attitudes towards hook up culture has largely remained
                            static (excluding same-sex promiscuity).
                            <sup>3</sup></p>
                        <p><em>Making it Philosophical:</em> Forgetting where Trump got the money from and that he was
                            married at the time of his encounter, there are still ethical issues to be dissected,
                            especially from a Kantian perspective on the ethics
                            of casual sex. No matter which way one tries to spin it, it is evident that “there is a
                            strong case to be made that CS&P [casual sex and promiscuity] necessarily objectify, and
                            that even if they do not, they likely objectify”
                            each individual in the act.<sup>4</sup>The biggest problem to consider is if it is morally
                            wrong to hook up with others. </p>
                        <p>For Kantians, the answer is yes, and their reasoning is that, in all (or at least most) cases
                            of casual hook ups, it is inextricably linked to deception and or coercion and (almost
                            always) objectification. Deception is defined
                            as what one would typically think it to be, a trick, lie, or even absence of truth to get
                            what one desires (in this case, sex). Clearly, Trump had to engage in deception when he
                            stole money to pay for the act and lie to his
                            wife about it. This is not typical of hook up culture. </p>
                        <p> What is more common is coercion, but it is harder to define. First, there are two types of
                            coercion, occurrent and dispositional. In occurrent coercion, it bypasses consent entirely,
                            as seen in cases of brutal rape. With dispositional
                            coercion, it can manifest in many ways, but boils down to the threat of harm and requires
                            that the other party “consent” to the act. In general, under dispositional coercion, if the
                            party refuses to participate in the “offer”
                            (it is really a threat), they will be harmed in some way. </p>
                        <p>In the Daniels-Trump scandal, ignoring the deception, it is interesting to point out what
                            forms of coercion may have been present. Was Daniels coerced because of Trump’s status in
                            society? Many would argue, yes. Because he was
                            in a position of power, and if Daniels refused, Trump implicitly (by his sheer nature of the
                            position he is in) threatens Daniels with repercussions. Was Daniels simply coerced because
                            she was being paid? Claiming “yes” is
                            a little more muddy, but a Kantian would generally agree on the definition that it is only
                            coercion if they are in a ‘desperate’ situation where it should be expected that she be paid
                            anyways, regardless of her performing the
                            act. This is easier to explain with an example:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>“Suppose that A is mired in quicksand and is slowly but surely approaching death.
                            When B happens along, A cries out to B for assistance. All B needs to do is throw A a rope.
                            B is quite willing to accommodate A, ‘provided you pay
                            me $100,000 over the next ten years.’ Is B making A an offer? Hardly! B, we must presume,
                            stands under a moral obligation to come to the aid of a person in serious distress, at least
                            whenever such assistance entails no significant
                            risk, sacrifice of time, and so forth. A is entitled to B’s assistance."
                            <sup>5</sup></blockquote>
                        <p>Clearly, the ‘offer’ that B claims it to be is really a threat, “Before B’s proposal, A
                            legitimately expected assistance from B, ‘no strings attached.’ In attaching a very
                            unwelcome string, B’s proposal effectively renders A worse
                            off. What B proposes, then, is not an offer of assistance. Rather, B threatens A with the
                            withholding of something (assistance) that A is entitled to have from B. (For clarity, I
                            don't think it is likely that Daniels was coerced
                            in this manner. She did not expect to get paid for doing nothing.) <span class="print">
                            </span>
                        </p>
                        <p>This may lead many to conclude that they are off the hook for engaging in hook up culture
                            because Trump engaged in deception and (likely) coercion to engage in casual sex, that he is
                            morally wrong for doing so. This is true, but
                            the biggest problem, and what happens with most, if not all, casual sex encounters is
                            objectification4. What’s worse, is that this objectification is merely that, nothing else,
                            in casual sex. It is at this point the argument
                            may then shift to “what is so wrong with objectifying others (using another simply as a tool
                            to get pleasure)?”. In an ideal situation, both parties find it pleasurable. It may also be
                            viewed as simple recreation, release,
                            or distraction. The problem with hook up culture though, is that this is simply not the
                            case. Less than half of people who have engaged in one-night stands rated it as they “were
                            glad they did it”, a positive experience.

                    </div>
                    <div class="col s12 m10">
                        <p>For my Public Intellectual Assignment, I decided to engage with Hope Ruse, a strong- willed
                            liberal friend of mine. She, in almost every sense of the word, belongs to and is an an
                            advocate of the liberal party and its values. Part
                            of this, is a view that sex in society can be positive and “hooking up” is a great thing.
                            This is not me putting words in her mouth. In fact, she can be quoted saying, “Everyone, or
                            at least most people, want sex. Therefore,
                            if they are consenting, then how can that not be good?” I can see this argument. Sex is
                            typically seen as a positive experience. Many movies and other works depict the losing of
                            virginity as something as a coming of age. What
                            I find problematic and posed to Hope is that most of these encounters where the hook ups
                            occur do not end up really improving the lives of the people engaging in the hookup. In
                            fact, as I told Hope, most of these experiences
                            these people rate as being negative. There is significant evidence saying that people are
                            not enjoying these experiences. She told me that she simply did not believe that. Was my
                            evidence too weak? What had I done wrong? I
                            tried to emphasize that I am not trying to say no one should ever have sex. I am just trying
                            to say that hook up culture has some strange effects that should be considered if one were
                            to hook up. These facts themselves put
                            the actor in the situation to be more likely not to hookup (probably) but I could not
                            understand why I was being met with such resistance. I brought up the additional point that,
                            if most of these people are not enjoying their
                            experiences, then they probably engaged in an act that they most likely did not agree to
                            during the encounter. The lack of communication is troubling and can coerce participants
                            into things they normally would never had originally
                            agreed to. Hope was able to see this point, but she still held that these people were adults
                            and she still did not understand why objectifying people is such a bad thing, especially
                            when the act is mutual. This is something
                            I never really considered before. I think this is something also special to sex and hooking
                            up alone. I cannot think of any other acts in which both parties seem to be using each other
                            as objects in such a mutual way. Perhaps,
                            this is something that people in society simply are okay with, something they are willing to
                            will to become a universal maxim. When I tried coming up with an answer to “What is so wrong
                            with people objectifying others?” I could
                            muster anything but, “Well, Kantianism says that using people as mere objects is one of the
                            most evil things one can do”. However, upon further reflection, I am not sure this statement
                            captures what Kant really meant. In sex,
                            people often use each other as objects, that is simply as a fact. In this case, the people
                            might not be using each other as mere objects, they pass the Kantian test. Another instance,
                            two (or more) people use each other as
                            mere objects in the sex act. In the ideal situation (which is unlikely), they both enjoy it
                            and mutually agreed to use each other this way. Is this “will”-able? Is this allowed to
                            become a universal maxim? I am not sure. I
                            would like to say it already is, but something to me still does not feel right. All the work
                            I did proving that hook-up culture is overall not a good idea still sits with me and I think
                            it might be because this is (hookup culture),
                            a bad maxim that society allowed. If we live in a society like this, how, then, can we ever
                            hope to change it? Do we even need to? I am unsure.

                        <h4>Consent in Casual Sex: Is it All That Matters?</h4>
                        <p>In the typical college setting, hooking up is generally seen as the expression of sexual
                            liberation. It is the greatest example of college freedom of choice and independence where
                            two parties are freely choosing to do what they want with their own bodies. However, for
                            morally permissible hookups, valid consent is required. Invalid consent directly violates
                            the autonomy of the person being ‘pursued’ or seduced; therefore, the hookup is morally
                            wrong. In this essay, I will argue that valid consent in a hookup may be impossible to
                            achieve. Additionally, I want to point out that even if valid consent is attained, there are
                            many problems with accepting casual sex as the only expression of sexual liberation and
                            would like to suggest more definitions. I will begin by exploring the situations where valid
                            consent is undermined, I will show how hookup culture coerces college students into
                            participating in hookups, and I will offer an acceptable solution to the problem with the
                            idea of sexual liberation today.

                        <p>According to Raja Halwani, professor of philosophy at the School of the Art Institute of
                            Chicago, “there is a strong case to be made that CS&P [casual sex and promiscuity]
                            necessarily objectify, and that even if they do not, they likely objectify” each individual
                            in the act.<sup>1</sup> My opponents would argue that consent is morally transformative, that it changes
                            the moral permissibility of a hookup and the objectification becomes null and void. If there
                            is valid consent, the hookup is morally permissible. But first, what is valid consent? There
                            is consensus around three things that are necessary for valid consent, consent that is
                            morally transformative:

                                is, a trick, lie, or even absence of truth to get what one desires (in this case, sex).

                                    <li>Suppose person B asks person A if they have any sexually transmitted diseases
                                        (STDs). Person A tells person B, “No,” because they know that person B would not
                                        have sex with them otherwise. Person A has committed an act of deception and any
                                        consent thereby given is invalid.

                                    <li>Person A has a STD that is dormant and undetectable. Person B has said in the
                                        past that they would not want to have sex with someone who has a STD. Person A
                                        does not consider themselves to have a STD, it is dormant and undetectable! Any
                                        consent given is valid, this is not an example of deception because person A is
                                        not lying at all, they believe they are telling the truth about themselves even
                                        though most would consider that is not the truth.

                                That there be no coercion. First, there are two types of coercion, occurrent and
                                dispositional. In occurrent coercion, it bypasses consent entirely, as seen in cases of
                                brutal rape. Obviously, consent is violated. With dispositional coercion, it can
                                manifest in many ways, but boils down to the threat of harm and requires that the other
                                party “consent” to the act. In general, under dispositional coercion, if the party
                                refuses to take part in the “offer” (it is really a threat), they are harmed in some
                                way.

                                        you have sex with me and then you can have your money.” Person B has coerced A
                                        because they were entitled to the money that was owed and adding the “offer”
                                        even if they might have wanted the sex makes them worse off. If they refuse,
                                        they will not receive the money they are entitled to.

                                        student is worse off after this offer and is being coerced.

                                        than they were before because refusing will not harm them. However, can a
                                        rational student truly refuse an offer such as this and expect future grades to
                                        not be affected by retaliation? Person B, even though they are “better off”, has
                                        been coerced.

                        <p>With the examples of what valid consent is laid out, it is easy to see now that there are
                            many limitations on what valid consent can really be. That is exactly why I wanted to lay
                            this out, getting valid consent is near impossible and unlikely. Even if someone consents
                            “yes”, it does not mean that the consent is valid.

                        <p>However, my own my peers and I still might believe that we can obtain valid consent. Okay,
                            let us grant that valid consent is attained. What is consent, though? At a base level, I am
                            arguing that consent is permission to use someone as an object. Similar to selling your
                            organs for profit, which is undeniably using your body as an object, hooking up for sensual
                            pleasure is just the same. There is a moral duty to not treat people, even yourself, as
                            objects. Giving someone permission to treat you as an object is morally wrong. In casual
                            sex, both the parties leave the encounter with no strings attached. There is an aspect of
                            emotional disconnectedness in the encounter. Both parties are simply expected to get their
                            sexual pleasure and leave. In many ways, it is just as objectifying as using a sex toy, only
                            this time it takes human form. Just because you may give permission for someone to use you
                            as an object, it does not mean that it is morally permissible. Is this objectification a big
                            deal? According to Immanuel Kant, he argued that it is in his formula of humanity: “Act in
                            such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or any other person, never as
                            a means, but always at the same time and end.”<sup>3</sup> The parties involved during a hookup are
                            there to please only themselves; that is their end.
                        </p>
                        <p>Professor Marino from Waterloo University believes that she may have an answer. Marino
                            proposes that definitions of “weak” instrumental use and “strong” instrumental use. In
                            “weak” instrumental use, “we treat someone in such a way that they further ends of our own,
                            consensually, while we do not concern ourselves with their ends... Weak use involves
                            respecting a person's stated permissions while ignoring the full range of their wishes and
                            desires.”<sup>4</sup> “Strong” instrumental use ignores both, it ignores the autonomy of the other human
                            and their wishes and desires. The reason “weak” use is okay, as seen in a hookup is because
                            it is, by definition, still respecting the other’s autonomy and not violating their rights.
                            When someone weakly uses another, they are simply forgetting to take into account the other
                            person’s humanity; they do not “concern” themselves with it. My problem with this is that it
                            suggests that somehow these encounters are just happening and there is no real intention
                            behind them. However, there is an intention and there is a point where someone agrees to be
                            used as an object. The person agreeing is morally culpable. The other, the one asking for
                            consent, is morally dismissed according to Marino’s theory, but it does nothing as far as
                            addressing if giving consent is morally permissible.
                        </p>
                        <p>Still, some may believe that their case does not apply, the case when the two parties are
                            truly taking each other’s ends into account and respecting each other’s humanity, treating
                            each other as ends. The argument I have made is against treating people merely as objects,
                            as a means to the end of sexual satisfaction. Someone may present that they are treating the
                            other person as an end. This is where I must conceded that, yes, it is morally permissible
                            if they are treating the other person as an end. But in what cases of casual sex are you
                            treating another person as an end? The whole purpose of casual sex is personal sexual
                            satisfaction. Someone may argue that it is not their purpose in engaging in casual sex; it
                            is to please their partner. If this is true, and they truly do it to satisfy and treat their
                            partner as an end (not for an ulterior motive such as pleasing themselves), then
                            congratulations, the sex is not morally wrong. However, this is not casual sex and is where
                            I draw the line. I cannot imagine a casual sexual encounter, a hookup, where this happens.
                        </p>
                        <p>Finally, I want to address the issue with casual sex today. We are living in a society that
                            accepts casual sex with valid consent is morally permissible. While it is nearly impossible
                            to get valid consent in many situations and it is questionable that consent is morally
                            transformative, casual sex is the norm, nonetheless. This acceptance has created a casual
                            sex culture, a hookup culture in the U.S. popular in college societies.<sup>5</sup> Hooking up is simply
                            seen as a part of college and dating life today. In a study done by Hope Reese, she found
                            that most students’ reasons for why they engaged in hookup culture was not to seek pleasure
                            but social status.<sup>6</sup> The biggest reason the students engaged in hookups was because they were
                            trying to fit in and seek approval from their peers. If college students don't participate,
                            they do not see an alternative for themselves; casual sex is the norm. When Reese asked her
                            students why they engaged in hookups, their answer was so that they could “fit in.” If this
                            is true, these students <span class="print"></span>are not giving valid consent, they are being coerced. Promoting
                            other ways to have relationships with others, Reese argues, is just as important as
                            promoting safe, casual sex. Sexual liberation must be re-thought to include abstinence,
                            chastity, the opportunity and choice to opt out of hookup culture without stigma, especially
                            because so many problems lurk around hooking up. Reese argues that when we engage in
                            hookups, especially college students, they are looking to connect with others. They want to
                            love and be loved. Paradoxically, a hookup requires that one does not feel emotion. By
                            including these extra categories in the idea of sexual liberation, by promoting more than
                            just hookup culture, we can hope to see students who are actually treating themselves with
                            respect and not just having sex to fit in.
                        </p>
                        <p>Attitudes towards hookup culture as sexual liberation among college students has largely been
                            static in the U.S. for some time.<sup>7</sup> These attitudes of accepting casual sex as the norm needs
                            to change. It is not the only way for people to connect and casual sex also simply has too
                            many problems with it. The hoops one would have to jump through to get valid consent alone
                            should deter anyone from engaging in it, and it is not even clear it is morally
                            transformative. Consent is not all that matters, ‘yes’ does not always mean ‘yes’. Accepting
                            casual sex as the norm also has negative effects on society. Sexual liberation’s definition
                            today too rigidly constricts many into believing that it is the only way to connect with
                            others and it must be expanded to include other forms as well.
